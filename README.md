## What works?

- Boot
- GPU acceleration
- Ethernet
- Keyboard + Trackpad (incl. Magic TrackPad 2 emulation)
- WiFi (incl. Handoff + AirDrop)
- Audio

## What doesn't work?

- Battery readout
- Power Management
- (For NVIDIA) Since the 8570W does not have an iGPU and this laptop only has a K1000M, there is no brightness control.
- SD-Card
- Trackpad won't show up in the macOS settings page when there's no battery readout
- TrackPoint

## Download and Install

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/SkyrilHD/HP-8570W-Hackintosh/releases/) page of this repo and download the latest release. Then, copy the EFI folder to your EFI partition... That's it.

## How to Install macOS Catalina

There are two ways you can install Catalina:

1. Have a working install of macOS, download the Installer from the App Store, then make a bootable Installer with createinstallmedia by using this command in Terminal `sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Catalina.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume`

2. If you are using Windows, use [macrecovery.py](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/winblows-install.html) from the offical OpenCore release package.

After you have created a bootable Installer, copy the EFI folder to the EFI partition and install as usual. After the installation, mount the EFI partition of the installed OS and copy the EFI folder to its partition.

If you have the original Intel Centrino Wireless-N 6205 card:
You need remove the broadcom kexts and replace them with [Airportitlwm](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases/tag/v1.2.0) and [IntelBluetoothFirmware](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware/releases/tag/1.1.2) to get both WiFi and Bluetooth working. But for the full macOS experience with AirDrop, Handoff and all of that, replace the Intel WiFi card.
